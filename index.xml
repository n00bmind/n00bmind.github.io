      <description>dodo-lang A sandbox to explore language design ideas while I learn more about compilers. I had written my own scripting language before, but never a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; language, and never writing all the code myself from scratch. At the moment it&amp;rsquo;s just barely a transpiler to C, but I hope to continue adding code generation and maybe even explore some optimization techniques.robotrider An engine/game still in very early development.</description>

      <description>Welcome!
I&amp;rsquo;m Oscar Pe√±as. I was born a loong time ago somewhere in the south coast of Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in computers almost since I can remember, ever since I got my amazing 8086 as a birthday present I felt so very curious about how it did what it did.
However it was when I first discovered the demoscene, in the mid 90s, that I really was hooked forever. I had to learn how to do all that!</description>
