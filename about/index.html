Welcome!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m Oscar Peñas. I was born a loong time ago somewhere in the south coast of Spain.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve been interested in computers almost since I can remember, ever since I got my amazing 8086 as a birthday present I felt so very curious about how it did what it did.</p>
<p>However it was when I first discovered the demoscene, in the mid 90s, that I really was hooked forever. I <em>had to</em> learn how to do all that! And so, well&hellip; here we are.</p>
<p>During my career I&rsquo;ve always been happier in gamedev, as I think it&rsquo;s the only field that shares a bit of that spirit and challenge. On this site you can find some of my related professional experience and some of the stuff I do in my (scarce) spare time.</p>
